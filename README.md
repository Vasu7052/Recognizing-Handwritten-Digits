# Recognizing Hand-written Digits

This is a computer program implementing a neural network that learns to recognize handwritten digits. The program is just few lines long, and uses no special neural network libraries (however Scikit-learn is used for supervised learning). But this short program can recognize digits with an accuracy over 96 percent, without human intervention. 

# Libraries used :
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Scikit-Learn

# Some Screenshots

Here are some of the screenshots of running program.
